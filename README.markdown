# Basic Blank for WordPress

Basic Blank is a no-frills starter theme for WordPress development. It started out as a lightly modified version of Chris Coyier's [BLANK theme](http://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme/), but morphed extensively over time to include HTML5 elements and some other modern WordPress goodness. 

Keep in mind that Basic Blank is just that â€“ a very simple starter theme that has worked well as a base for my projects, and I'm sharing for any and all to customize to their hearts' content. Happy coding.

If you're looking for a more robust starter theme solution, you may want to check out [Roots](http://www.rootstheme.com/), [Bones](http://themble.com/bones/) or [Underscores](http://underscores.me/).
